# PokemonSpider

## Project Introduction

Authorï¼š@Galaxyzeta

I am a college student from China HDU, I love playing pokemon games and so do my roommate, so I write this script to make it more convenient to look up Pokemon key data when the Internet is down.

This is a spider script that can be used to grab Pokemon data on 52poke.com.

## Update Records

### **2019-12-03 0:23**

First version completed with a record of 300 pokemons, including:

- Name in CHS, JPN, ENG
- Abilities and Types in different forms
- Original Statistics
- Egg Group and Steps

**Problems:**

1. Unable to fetch abilities of Pokemons that own special forms.

**What to do next:**

1. Try to get a Pokemon name list.
2. Try to correct ability mismatch.
3. Test my script on the rest of Pokemons.
